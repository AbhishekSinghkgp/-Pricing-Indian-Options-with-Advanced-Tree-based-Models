# -Pricing-Indian-Options-with-Advanced-Tree-based-Models

 This thesis explores the efficacy of advanced tree-based machine learning models in
 pricing options in the Indian financial market, specifically focusing on options based
 on the Nifty Index. Traditional option pricing methods, like the Black-Scholes model,
 have long served the financial community but often fall short under the dynamic and
 complex market conditions prevalent in emerging markets such as India due to rigid
 assumptions about market efficiency, volatility, and liquidity. This study evaluates
 and compares the performance of several tree-based models, including Random For
est, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to address these shortcomings. Using five years of
 historical option data from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India spanning,
 from April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2024, this research incorporates data fields such
 as open interest changes and market sentiment indicators, aiming to enhance the
 predictive accuracy of these models. By comparing these advanced models against
 the traditional Black-Scholes model, this study aims to provide a comprehensive un
derstanding of their relative strengths and limitations in the context of the Indian
 options market.
